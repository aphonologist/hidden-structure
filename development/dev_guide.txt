Dev guide:

Packaging and running from command line
--------------------------
+The project currently uses the build tool SBT, which you'll need to install
+To run the project, starting in the main directory, start SBT (command: sbt)
+Compile the project (command: compile). This creates two .JAR files gui.jar and console.jar.
+To run the console program, from the command-line run "java -jar console.jar". You will need to give
 the arguments in the run command (see console guide for description of arguments
+To run the gui program, from the command-line run "java -jar gui.jar"

+Note: if you don't have JAVA_HOME pointing to your java folder, then the css components won't load. 
 The gui will work, but it will look bad, and you will get a warning that resource "com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.css" was not found.

Editing
----------
+The main file for work on the GUI is GUI.java
+The main files for working on the learners are EDL.java and GLA.java
+To change the arguments in the console program, work in learn.java
