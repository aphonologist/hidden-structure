Dev guide:

Running from command line
--------------------------
+The project currently uses the build tool SBT, which you'll need to install
+To run the project, starting in the main directory, start SBT (command: sbt)
+Compile the main project (command: compile)
+Specify which project you are running, gui or console (command: project gui)
+Compile project (command: compile)
+Run project (command: run)
+Note: if you don't have JAVA_HOME pointing to your java folder, then the css components won't load. 
 The gui will work, but it will look bad, and you will get a warning that resource "com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.css" was not found.
